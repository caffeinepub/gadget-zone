  "summary": "The BuildRequest requires a very narrow change: update only one specific Hero <img> in frontend/src/App.tsx (exact src and className) and make no other changes anywhere. The diff evidence is truncated and does not show the targeted <img> element, so the required change cannot be verified from the provided diff summary. Additionally, files other than App.tsx were modified, which conflicts with the “no other code/markup/styling anywhere else” acceptance criterion.",

      "requirement": "In frontend/src/App.tsx, update ONLY the Hero section logo <img> at XPath /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/section[1]/div[2]/div[1]/img[1] to have src=\"/assets/Gadget Zone-Logo-1.png\" and className=\"h-24 md:h-32 mx-auto mb-6\", without changing any other attributes (e.g., alt) and without modifying anything else in the project.",
      "reason": "The diff for frontend/src/App.tsx is truncated and does not include the Hero <img> markup; therefore there is no direct evidence that the specified <img> src/className were updated exactly, nor that no other attributes on that <img> were left unchanged.",

      "reason": "These items are not requested and are listed in frontend-file-summaries.txt as part of the project, conflicting with the constraint to only change the selected <img>. The diff summary does not show corresponding file modifications for those paths (only the summary file itself was modified), making them appear as unrequested additions/claims.",
