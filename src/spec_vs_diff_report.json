  "summary": "App.tsx adds a service-to-content mapping and state for a selected service plus a ref intended for a bottom description section, and project summaries describe clickable service cards that scroll to a fixed bottom description section. However, the diff evidence is insufficient/unclear for the required bottom-section Call/WhatsApp actions, mobile sticky-bar non-obscuring behavior, and the requirement for *exact* description strings (mapping currently stores descriptions as arrays of sentences rather than the single exact strings provided).",

      "id": "REQ-53",
      "requirement": "Implement the exact bottom-section content mapping (English) so each selected item shows the exact provided heading and description text (no paraphrasing).",
      "reason": "In App.tsx, each service description is stored as an array of sentence strings rather than the single exact description string specified; without evidence of concatenation into the exact provided text, the 'exact text' acceptance criterion is not demonstrably met.",

      "reason": "The provided App.tsx excerpt shows phoneNumber/whatsappNumber constants and imports WhatsAppQuickMessages, but does not show the bottom section rendering Call and WhatsApp actions/buttons as required (truncation prevents verification).",
