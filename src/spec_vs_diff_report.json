  "summary": "The diff does not provide sufficient direct evidence that the hero logo <img> in frontend/src/App.tsx was updated to prevent clipping or that a new transparent/padded logo asset was added under frontend/public/assets/generated. Additionally, there is evidence of changes unrelated to the requested hero-logo-only scope (e.g., Google Maps link standardization and inclusion of an educational section), though it’s unclear whether these were newly introduced or pre-existing due to truncation.",

      "id": "REQ-39",
      "requirement": "Update ONLY the hero logo <img> rendering in frontend/src/App.tsx so the full logo is always visible (no top/bottom clipping) across mobile/desktop, preserving aspect ratio and avoiding cropping.",
      "reason": "The provided App.tsx diff is truncated before the hero logo <img> markup, so there is no concrete diff evidence showing the <img> sizing/object-fit/overflow changes needed to guarantee no clipping or cropping.",
